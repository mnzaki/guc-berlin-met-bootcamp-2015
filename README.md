# GUC Berlin MET Bootcamp
So you found the github repo!

This is an example git repository where we will keep some documents and files
for your reference. We will also have a small git practice session in which
you'll clone this repository and make some changes to it!

Please read the [Welcome Document](welcome.md)!    
Make sure you have the necessary software installed and ready before we get to Berlin!
